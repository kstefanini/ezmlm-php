# ezmlm-php
A RESTful API to access ezmlm mailing lists.

! Still in early stage. Needs a lot of refactoring. Does not cover every use case yet.

Requires :

- ezmlm-idx
- grep
- php5-imap
- mailparse (PECL extension)

Uses :
- [php-mime-mail-parser](https://github.com/php-mime-mail-parser/php-mime-mail-parser)

Inspired by ezmlm-php previously found on http://www.unixpimps.org/software/ezmlm-php
